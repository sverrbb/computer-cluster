# computer-cluster
Mandatory assignment in the course IN1000 - introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.

The program is supposed to keep track of a number of computer clusters and all the components of a computer cluster. A cluster can be used to distribute heavy calculations on many machines so that they can work in parallel. That way, a simulation that would take a month to run on a regular machine can be run on the arithmetic cluster in a few hours instead.
